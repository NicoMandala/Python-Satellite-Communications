Input: String, Key
Output: Encrypted String
Comments: The value of each character(from ascii table) is added repetitively over the length of the string.
            Easy to implement| Easy to decipher by people who recognize them| Used only to encrypt alphabet

Example: "The fox is red.", "abc" => The fox is red --> The ascii values are added and the result is generated as the output.
              String         key     abcabcabcabcab
               


Caesar cipher(legacy cipher): Add a constant number 3 to every value alphabet
ex: ABC --> DEF
This code can be modified to a similar idea by giving a single character such as "a" to be the key.
